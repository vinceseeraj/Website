<h1 style="color:white">Solutions</h1>

<p style="color:white">Anonymous have solved multiple problems under their own authority. 
They refuse to follow the laws of any government. 
The United States have multiple laws ruling against Anonymous and any of their activities. 
Despite all these laws anonymous still continue to protect the people from the government.</p>

<p style="color:white"> Anonymous have the ability of causing an economic impact. In the US alone anonymous caused over $50 million in damages in a short period of time.<sup>1</sup> </p>
<h2 style="color:white">China Censorship</h2>
<p style="color:white">Anonymous was furious at China. They decided to declare cyber war against the government of Hong Kong. Anonymous hacked hundreds of Chinese government websites, 
these sites were defaced and the Chinese government were warned to stop oppressing the people. The citizens were left with a very motivational speech from anonymous. 
Anonymous promised to help the people. Anonymous caused the Chinese government millions of dollars. The people of china saw hope and continued to protest.<sup>2</sup></p>
<h2 style="color:white">NSA</h2>
<p style="color:white">After Edward Snowden leaked the Intel that the NSA was spying on U.S. citizens, anonymous had a field day. They were very angry that the NSA was violating every citizen rights.
 In response Anonymous hacked the FBI website. The website was defaced, taking anonymous activities to another level. 
 The FBI lost millions of dollars in the process and soon after the Supreme Court ruled against the NSA actions.<sup>3</sup></p>
<h2 style="color:white">Stealing Anonymous Logo</h2>
<p style="color:white">Anonymous was furious that a French film making company trademarked their world famous logo, and wanted to use it for commercial purposes. They also intended on making money with the logo. Anonymous warned the Film company, but they refused to listen. Anonymous defaced their website and caused them quite a bit of money. 
They also released confidential information about the company.<sup>4</sup></p>
<h2 style="color:white">ISIS</h2>
<p style="color:white">Anonymous wanted to take action on ISIS. Anonymous declared Cyber war on ISIS. They defaced many of their websites and tried to cut their funding. The people were desperate to stop ISIS and their horrible actions. This shows Anonymous can make an economic change and cause a revolutions. ISIS plans were delayed as their funding were cut. It cost them millions to repair their websites and also Anonymous leaked intel about the terrorist group. 
The U.S. later launched air strikes against ISIS<sup>5</sup></p>
