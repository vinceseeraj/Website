Voice recognition is useful in determining if a voice recording belongs to a certain individual or not. Voice recognition can be used to verify the identity of an individual and allow them to access their confidential information. Major banks used voice recognition to verify their customers and to ensure protection. Voice recognition is commonly used to perform commands without the physical interaction such as unlocking the password to an iphone or writing words without hands. Voice recognition can also be very helpful to a person with disabilities that can not physically operate a device.

<p style="color:white;text-indent: 40px" align="justify">The goal of this project was to
	create a system that could recognize speech patterns and distinguish between different speakers. To do this, we need to follow distinct voice recognition matching techniques. This involved the use of the MFCC, or Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients, code algorithm, and VQ, or Vector Quantization method. The MFCC uses DSP methods such as the Hamming Window, Fourier Transforms, and Frame Blocking, to achieve the extraction of voice. In turn, these are implemented into the VQ method for the system to recognize and search 
	for a pattern from the Mel-Frequency, so the system can accurately identify the correct voice.
