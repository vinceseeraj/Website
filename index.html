<p style="color:white">Speaker recognition is the process of automatically recognizing who is speaking on the basis of individual information included in speech waves. This technique makes it possible to use the speaker's voice to verify their identity and control access to services such as voice dialing, banking by telephone, telephone shopping, database access services, information services, voice mail, security control for confidential information areas, and remote access to computers.
Speech input is typically recorded at a sampling rate of above 10,000 Hz. 
This sampling frequency was chosen to minimize the effects of aliasing during analog-to-digital conversion. 
These sampled signals can capture all frequencies up to 5 kHz, which cover most energy of sounds that are generated by humans. 
The main purpose of the MFCC processor is to mimic the behavior of the human ears.
MFCC’s are based on the known variation of the human ear’s critical bandwidths with frequency, filters spaced linearly at low frequencies and logarithmically at high frequencies have been used to capture the phonetically important characteristics of speech.	
In addition, rather than the speech waveforms themselves, MFFC’s are shown to be less susceptible to the mentioned variations. 
The 5 techniques depicted will be shown in more detail in their respective sections.
